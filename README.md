# AMPL-
Mathematical Programming Language for Optimization

These Assignments are done as a part of Advanced Analytics & Metaheuristics course in my Graduate School at University of Oklahoma. This course deals with prescriptive Analytics & using Artificial Intelligence algorithms for Decision Making. I have used AMPL for mathematical formulation of Linear and Integer Programming, Network optimization problems.
